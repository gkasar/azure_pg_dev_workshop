The previous chapters provided some basic Azure hands-on experience. It is important to understand high-level concepts before moving to more advanced examples and concepts. After reviewing these building block concepts, it is time to set up a development environment and get some hands-on architecture experience by working through the hands-on labs and application modernization journey. There will be experience with both Windows and Linux infrastructures.

It is time to explore the various architecture and deployment options available when deploying an application and its corresponding PostgreSQL database.

<h2><b>About this Workshop</b></h2>

Welcome to this Azure PostgreSQL Developer Workshop.

In this workshop, you will learn how about PostgreSQL fundamentals and how to implement modern data applications that take advantage of Azure Database for PostgreSQL using a hands-on lab approach.

This content is designed for data developers who have a basic working knowledge of PostgreSQL and the SQL language.

This workshop is intended to be taken as a self-paced training.

This **README.MD** file explains how the workshop is structured, what you will learn, and the technologies you will use in this solution.

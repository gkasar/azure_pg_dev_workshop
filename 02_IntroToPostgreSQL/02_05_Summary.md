This module explained everyday use cases for PostgreSQL and illustrated the typical IaaS and PaaS deployment approaches. Additional hybrid approaches to hosting PostgreSQL applications and databases on Microsoft Azure were discussed as well. Core approaches to managing Microsoft Azure resources, including imperative tools (like the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell) and declarative tools (like ARM templates and Terraform) were introduced.

Using one or more of the various tools presented will assist in getting the database instance(s) migrated to Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server in the most efficient manner possible.

The emphasis of this guide will continue to be on the advantages of Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server.
